 Project: End-to-End Financial Model for Refined Edible Oil Manufacturing Unit

📍 Sector: FMCG | Edible Oils | Manufacturing
🧾 Tool Used: Excel VBA-Enabled Macros (.xlsm), Project Finance Report (PDF)

🚀 Overview:
Developed a comprehensive financial model and management input analysis for a proposed Refined Edible Oil Manufacturing Plant with a total project cost of ₹210–225 Cr. The plant is designed to process Palm Oil (1.8 Lakh TPA), Mustard Oil (45,000 TPA), and Soft Oils (90,000 TPA). The project includes site development, civil work, machinery installation, and operational structuring.

📊 Key Highlights:

✅ Created a fully dynamic and automated Excel-based financial model with built-in macros for scenario analysis, interest calculations, and cash flow projections.
✅ Integrated cost breakdowns for land development, civil works, plant & machinery (₹149 Cr), utilities, and other fixed assets.
✅ Modeled debt-equity structuring at 1.86:1 and incorporated assumptions for interest during construction, contingency, and working capital margin.
✅ Captured manufacturing processes (Degumming, Bleaching, Deodorization, Fractionation, Interesterification).
✅ Implemented pricing strategies, raw material logistics, manpower planning, depreciation methods (as per Companies Act), and energy costs.
✅ Conducted industrial and market outlook analysis using sector data on domestic oilseed productivity, import/export trends, and consumption behavior.

📈 Outcome & Use Cases:
Helped simulate financing strategies and profitability over 8+ years.
Used by stakeholders for bank loan proposals, investor pitches, and feasibility evaluation.

Offered a blueprint for setting up a fully functional edible oil manufacturing plant, from project planning to commercial operations.
